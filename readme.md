This really needs a new name.

## Description

Imagine a game where you and 5 - 20 of your friends can team up to conquer space in a spacefaring station/ship, where each of you have a unique role to play. Together, you pursue your objective, defying the universe's attempts to bring your excursion to an end. Between saboteurs set out to sabotage your systems and kill your crew, to environemntal hazards destined to blow holes in your fragile metal home, to ship malfunctions making their best effort to vent your O2, among other perilous situations, merely surviving will take the combined wits of your whole crew.

This game already exists: Space Station 13! However, it is built for an interesting platform, so there is room to build upon the game's experience by implementing as a standalone game.

## Objectives (for now)

- Put out an initial prototype as soon as the keyboard will allow!
- Learn as much Rust as possible!
